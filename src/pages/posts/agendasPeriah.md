# Agendas

Select two before battle.

## Tyrranic War

## Periah Nexus

### **TO THE LAST**

At the start of the battle you can select up to three units for your Crusade army that are on the battlefield.  
For each of those units, at the end of the battle:

- If that unit is not destroyed it gains **2XP**.
- If that unit is not Below Half-strength it gains **1XP**.
- For each of those units that is not destroyed, you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment**.

### **CRITICAL RESOURCES**

At the start of the battle, your opponent must select two different objective markers on the battlefield.  
_(If there is only one objective marker, only that objective marker is selected)._  
At the end of the battle, select one of those objective markers. If you control that objective marker, you can select up to three units from your Crusade army that are within range of that objective marker. Each of those units gains **2XP**, and for each selected unit, you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment**.

### **KING SLAYER**

Each time a model from your Crusade army destroys an enemy **CHARACTER** unit, that model's unit gains **2XP** and you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment** _(to a maximum of 4 Blackstone Fragments)_.  
In addition, each time a model from your Crusade army destroys the enemy **WARLORD**, that model's unit gains an additional **2XP**.

### **DRIVE HOME THE BLADE**

At the end of the battle, you can select up to three units from your Crusade army _(excluding **AIRCRAFT**)_ that are wholly within **6''** of your opponent's battlefield edge.  
If your opponent does not have a battlefield edge in the mission being played, you can select up to three units from your Crusade army _(excluding **AIRCRAFT**)_ that are wholly within your opponent's deployment zone instead. Each of those units gains **3XP**.

### **RECOVER BLACKSTONE DATA**

At the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one **INFANTRY** or **MOUNTED** unit from your Crusade army that is not Battle-shocked and is eligible to shoot. That unit is tasked with recovering blackstone data and is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge that turn.

At the end of that turn, if that unit is within range of an objective marker you control that is not in your deployment zone, roll one D6:

- On a **4-5**, that unit gains **1XP**.
- On a **6**, that unit gains **2XP** and you gain **1CP**.

Each time a unit from your Crusade army gains XP as a result of this Agenda, you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment** _(to a maximum of 3)_.

### **CENTRAL POSITION**

At the end of your Command phase, each **CHARACTER** unit from your Crusade army that is within **3''** of the center of the battlefield gains **1XP**.  
If you gain **4 or more XP** as a result of this Agenda, you gain **4 Blackstone Fragments**.

### **REAP A TALLY**

For every third enemy unit that is destroyed, select one unit from your Crusade army that destroyed one or more enemy units this battle. That selected unit gains **2XP** and you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment** _(to a maximum of 2)_.

### **PSYCHIC BEACONS**

At the end of the battle, select two or more **PSYKER CHARACTER** units from your Crusade army that are wholly within different table quarters _(but only one per table quarter)_. Each of those units gains **2XP** and you gain **4 Blackstone Fragments**.

### **RE-ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION**

At the start of the battle, your opponent must select one objective marker on the battlefield to be the **Comms Array**.  
At the end of the battle, if you control that objective marker and one or more **CHARACTER** units from your Crusade army are within range of it _(excluding Battle-shocked units)_, select one of those units. That unit gains **4XP** and you gain **4 Blackstone Fragments**.

### **MONSTROUS TARGETS**

Each time a model from your Crusade army destroys an enemy **MONSTER** or **VEHICLE** unit _(excluding **DEDICATED TRANSPORTS**)_, that model's unit gains **2XP**.  
If the destroyed unit was **TITANIC**, that model's unit gains **4XP** instead.

### **ERADICATE THE SWARM**

Each time a unit from your Crusade army is selected to shoot or fight, if while resolving those attacks six or more enemy models are destroyed, that unit gains **1XP**.

### **FORWARD OBSERVERS**

At the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one unit from your army that is not Battle-shocked, that Remained Stationary this turn, and is eligible to shoot. That unit is tasked to perform reconnaissance and until the end of your turn is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge.

At the end of your opponent's next turn, or at the end of the battle _(whichever comes first)_ if that unit is wholly within your opponent's deployment zone, that unit gains **2XP** and you gain **1CP**.

### **LOOT CACHES**

At the start of the battle, all objective markers are caches and will remain so until looted.

At the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one unit from your Crusade army that is not Battle-shocked and is eligible to shoot. That unit is tasked to loot an objective marker and until the end of your turn is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge.

At the end of that turn, if that unit is in range of a cache objective marker that you control, that objective marker is looted and that unit gains **2XP**.

### **MALEFIC HUNTER**

Each time a model from your Crusade army destroys an enemy **PSYKER** or **SYNAPSE** unit, that model's unit gains **1XP**.  
If the destroyed unit is a **CHARACTER** unit, that model's unit gains an additional **1XP**.

## **STRATEGIC FOOTING AGENDAS**

### **AGGRESSIVE - FIRST INTO THE FRAY**

At the end of the first battle round, select up to three units from your Crusade army that are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. The selected unit gains **2XP** and you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment** for each unit selected.

### **BALANCED - CALCULATED DESTRUCTION**

Each time a unit from your Crusade army destroys an enemy unit that is within range of an objective marker, it gains **1XP** _(to a maximum of 3XP per unit)_.  
For every 3 enemy units destroyed in this way, you gain **1 Blackstone Fragment** _(to a maximum of 2)_.

### **DEFENSIVE - HOLD STEADY**

At the end of the battle, if at least half of your Crusade army's units are not destroyed, you can select up to three units from your Crusade army that are not destroyed. The selected units each gain **2XP** and you gain **3 Blackstone Fragments**.
