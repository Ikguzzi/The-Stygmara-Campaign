# Galomarian Streetfighters

The Galomarian Streetfighters are a distinguished Astra Militarum regiment known for their expertise in urban warfare. Hailing from the Galomar system, they've gained renown for their adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity, especially in urban warfare scenarios and hostile environments within their system.

**Combat Doctrine:** Renowned for their urban combat skills, they navigate complex cityscapes with ease, using cover, ambush points, and close-quarter tactics to outmaneuver adversaries. Additionally, they employ heavy artillery and tanks to clear enemy fortifications.

**Adaptive Strategies:** The Galomarian Streetfighters' adaptability sets them apart. They swiftly adjust tactics to suit terrain and adversaries, whether fighting within cities or engaging in orbital combat, maximizing their effectiveness.

**Regimental Culture:** Emphasizing discipline, precision, and adaptability, the regiment fosters pride in marksmanship and unity among soldiers. Officers instill the importance of each soldier's role, resulting in a cohesive and well-coordinated unit.

**Notable Campaigns:** The Galomarian Rifles have participated in numerous campaigns across the Galamar system, defending Imperial interests against various threats. Their most celebrated victory was the Catatoni campaign where the Galomarian ceased the starport on Catatoni Prime against a superior force. This victory led to the recapture of the planet.

**Lore:** During the Great Crusade, the Galomar system belonged to a lost human civilization that prioritized sprawling cities and industries. After the campaign, a Solar Auxilia force governed the system in the Emperor's name, expanding cities and industries, and supplying military equipment to other Imperial systems.

During the Horus Heresy, Galomar initially sided with the Emperor, but a betrayal by the fencibles and garrison on Galomar III 006.M31 led to heavy fighting over control of the system. Brutal fighting over industrial zones and cities built the foundation of the Galomarian expertise in urban fighting.

Post-Siege of Terra, Imperial forces reclaimed the system, defeating enemy forces during the Siege of Khentâ€™s Port 021.M31. Surviving rebel forces sought independence in the distant asteroid belts, leading to ongoing conflict, and forcing a split in the Streetfighters' forces.

The Fall of Cadia and the Great Rift's creation isolated Galomar, causing strained supplies, chaos cult invasions, and skirmishes among planets and rebels. Despite this, new regiments were raised for the Adeptus Ministorum, sent to distant campaigns.
